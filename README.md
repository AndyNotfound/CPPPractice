# C++ Practice
This repository is an assignment for my university's C++ excercises, it's a simple one. In this assignment we were doing some debugging.<br>
exFive and exSeven are both C++ Code but in wrong extension (.c), this is part of the practice, you need to rename it back to .cpp to run it.<br><br>
